Design a program in java that identifies answer to the following questions:(a) What is called first during an object creation, a static block or a constructor?
(b) How many times each (a constructor and a static block) is executed?
(c) Can we use non-static variables inside static methods? Why?



package com.company;

public class Class {
    int n=10;
    Class()
    {
        System.out.println("inside constructor");
    }
    static
    {
        System.out.println("inside static block");
    }
    public static void m1()
    {
        System.out.println(n);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Class obj=new Class();
        Class.m1();
    }
}
